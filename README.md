Shroudly is the Shrouder microblogging platform.  

Shroudly is designed to help people connect to the the things that matter to them most- publicly *and* privately.

The goal of the Shroudly project is to provide a secure microblogging platform with accompanying web (browser-based), mobile (iOS, Android) and desktop (OSX, Windows) clients, maximizing user-controlled privacy in keeping with NoTrustâ„¢ principles.
